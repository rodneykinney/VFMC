# VFMC

VFMC is a tool for practicing FMC attempts virtually.

# Installation

Windows and Mac executables can be found [here](https://github.com/rodneykinney/VFMC/releases/latest)

On any platform, you can also install using `pip install vfmc`

# Approach

VFMC tracks all the steps of an FMC attempt: EO - DR - HTR - (FR) - Slice - Finish. 

## A realistic alternative to pencil+paper+cube

Find similar solutions to what you would find in a manual attempt.
You should be able to do it more quickly than in a manual attempt, because you can cut out time 
normally spent scrambling, NISS-ing, and recovering from mistakes.

## Depth-vs-breadth trade-offs

Decide how manu solutions to write down for each step, 
and how much time to spend on each of them. Decide what works best for you.

## Case recognition

See, at each step, the case name for getting to the next step, and show the bad pieces 
that must be solved to get there.

## Optimal solutions for each step

Use the integrated solver to verify that see whether you've found the optimal
solution for reaching the next step.you've found the reach the next step. It will show
you the shortest solution that hasn't been written down already, allowing you to check whether 
or not you've found optimal for that step.
