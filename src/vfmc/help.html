<p>
    Enter <b>scramble("...")</b> to load a scramble.<br>
    Enter <b>scramble</b> to generate a new random scramble.

<h3>Solving Individual Steps</h3>
<p>
    Move from step to step by typing the name of the step you want to work on.<br>
    The display will show the bad corners/edges for the cube in its current state.<br>
    Available steps are: <b>eofb</b>,<b>eorl</b>,<b>eoud</b>,<b>drud</b>,<b>drrl</b>,<b>drfb</b>,<b>htr</b>,<b>fb</b>,<b>slice</b>,<b>finish</b>
</p>
<h4>Display</h4>
<p>
    When starting a step, the cube will reset its orientation <br>
    putting the DR axis on top and the EO axis in front.<br>
    Change the orientation by entering <b>x</b>, <b>y'</b>, <b>z2</b>, etc.<br>
    Fine-tune the orientation by dragging the mouse in the display.
</p>
<p>
    By default, only the bad edges and corners are drawn in the display. <br>
    Enter <b>display(corners="...", edges="...")</b> to change what is drawn in the display<br>
    where "..." is either "all", "none", or "bad"
</p>
<h4>Moves</h4>
<p>
    Enter moves (e.g. <b>u' r2 f</b>) to apply them to the cube.<br>
    Alternatively, double-click on the final set of moves to the right of the display to edit the moves directly.<br>
</p>
<p>
    Enter <b>reset</b> to return to the beginning of the current step.<br>
    Enter <b>niss</b> to switch between normal and inverse scrambles.
</p>
<h4>Solver</h4>
<p>
    Enter <b>solve</b> at any point to find the shortest unknown solution to the current step.<br>
    Enter <b>solve(n)</b> to find the next <b>n</b> solutions (up to 50 at at time)
</p>
<h3>Building a Full Solution</h3>
<p>
    Enter <b>save</b> to save the current cube to the list of solutions at the bottom.<br>
    Enter <b>back</b> to return to the previous step.
</p>
<p>
    Enter <b>comment("...")</b> to specify a comment for the current step<br>
    Enter <b>done</b> to mark the current step with a strike-through
</p>
<p>
    Click on any step at the bottom to see the steps that precede or follow it.<br>
    Double click to load a step and start working on it.<br>
    The steps that are active in the display are drawn in bold.
