<h3>Solving Individual Steps</h3>
<p>
    Move from step to step by typing the name of the step you want to work on.<br>
    The display will show the bad corners/edges for the cube in its current state.<br>
    Available steps are: <b>eofb</b>,<b>eorl</b>,<b>eoud</b>,<b>drud</b>,<b>drrl</b>,<b>drfb</b>,<b>htr</b>,<b>fb</b>,<b>slice</b>,<b>finish</b>
</p>
<p>
    When starting a step, the cube will reset its orientation to put the DR axis on top and the EO axis in front.<br>
    Change the orientation by entering <b>x</b>, <b>y'</b>, <b>z2</b>, etc.<br>
    Fine-tune the orientation by dragging the mouse in the display.
</p>
<p>
    Enter moves (R, F', U2, etc.) to apply those moves to the cube.<br>
    Enter <b>niss</b> to switch between normal and inverse scrambles. <br>
    Enter <b>reset</b> to return to the beginning of the current step.
</p>
<p>
    Enter <b>solve</b> at any point to find the shortest unknown solution to the current step.<br>
    Enter <b>solve(n)</b> to find the next <b>n</b> solutions (up to 50 at at time)
</p>
<h3>Building a Full Solution</h3>
<p>
    Enter <b>save</b> to save the current cube to the list of solutions at the bottom.<br>
    Enter <b>back</b> to return to the previous step.
</p>
<p>
    Enter <b>comment("...")</b> to specify a comment for the current step<br>
    Enter <b>done</b> to indicate you are finished checking the current step, marking it with a strike-through
</p>
<p>
    Click on any step at the bottom to see the steps that precede or follow it.<br>
