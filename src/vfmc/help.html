    Enter <b>scramble("...")</b> to load a scramble.<br>
    Enter <b>scramble</b> to generate a new random scramble.

<h3>Solving Individual Steps</h3>
<p>
    Move from step to step by entering the name of the step you want to work on.<br>
    Available steps are: <b>eofb</b>,<b>eorl</b>,<b>eoud</b>,<b>drud</b>,<b>drrl</b>,<b>drfb</b>,<b>htr</b>,<b>fr</b>,<b>finish</b>,<b>insertions</b>
</p>
<h4>Display</h4>
<p>
    When starting a step, the cube will reset its orientation <br>
    putting the DR axis on top and the EO axis in front.<br>
    Change the orientation by entering <b>x</b>, <b>y'</b>, <b>z2</b>, etc.<br>
    Fine-tune the orientation by dragging the mouse in the display.
</p>
<p>
    By default, only the bad edges and corners are drawn in the display. <br>
    Use the "Display Preferences" to change what is drawn for each step.
</p>
<p>
    Press the Ctrl/Option key to temporarily hide the front faces of the cube.
</p>
<h4>Moves</h4>
<p>
    Enter moves (e.g. <b>u' r2 f</b>) to apply them to the cube.<br>
    Alternatively, double-click on the final set of moves to the right of the display to edit the moves directly.
</p>
<p>
    Enter <b>reset</b> to return to the beginning of the current step.<br>
    Enter <b>niss</b> to switch between normal and inverse scrambles.
</p>
<h4>Solver</h4>
<p>
    Enter <b>solve</b> at any point to find the shortest unknown solution to the current step.<br>
    Enter <b>solve(n)</b> to find the next <b>n</b> solutions (up to 50 at at time)
</p>
<p>
    Enter <b>mallard("...", n)</b> to solve a chain of steps simultaneously using a subset of the <a href="https://github.com/Jobarion/cubelib">mallard syntax</a>.<br>
    Available steps: <code>EO, DR, HTR, FR, FIN</code><br>
    Available options: <code>max, abs-max, niss</code><br>
    Examples: <code>"EO[max=5] &gt; DR[abs-max=11]"</code>, or <code>"HTR &gt; FIN"</code>
</p>
<h3>Building a Full Solution</h3>
<p>
    Enter <b>save</b> to save the current cube to the list of solutions at the bottom.<br>
    Enter <b>comment("...")</b> to specify a comment for the current step<br>
    Enter <b>done</b> to mark the current step with a strike-through, or <b>forget</b> to remove it entirely
</p>
<p>
    The steps that are active in the display are drawn in bold.<br>
    Click on any step at the bottom to see the steps that precede or follow it.<br>
    Double click to load a step and start working on it.<br>
    Hit delete to forget the selected step entirely
</p>
<p>
    The <b>insertions</b> step rewrites the solution to be all on normal and brings up a dialog
    showing the remaining bad pieces. The view changes depending on the cursor
    position, as if you had rniss-ed at that position. You can widen moves by adding 'w' and
    otherwise edit the moves. The edits will be automatically converted into insertion markers
    when saving.
</p>
<h3>Saving/Loading Your Session</h3>
<p>
    Enter <b>save_session("...")</b> to save all of your activity so far to a log file.<br>
    Enter <b>load_session("...")</b> to replay a saved session.
