# VFMC Beta Testers

At this stage, I'm keeping the instructions intentionally minimal, 
just to see how easy it is to jump in. Tutorials and more thorough
documentation will come later.

The software is in beta, but it's not secrets. Feel free to share this link with anybody you think might be interested.

Download the appropriate release [here](https://github.com/rodneykinney/VFMC/releases/latest).
You will probably have to disable security features to download and/or run it. 
Hit the "help" button and get started!

Add any feedback you have to https://github.com/rodneykinney/VFMC/issues/2. 
All opinions welcome! 

Thanks for helping to test VFMC!
